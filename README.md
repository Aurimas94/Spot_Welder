# Spot_Welder
Simple but robust spot welder using microwave oven transformer with modified secondary winding. It can be used for various applications like battery welding etc. 

If schematics will be needed, let me know.

Briefly: Control consists of zero crossing to detect energy peaks and PWM generation for thyristor module. 
With encoder you can chose welding time (peak cycles) and power (duty cycle).
